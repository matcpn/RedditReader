============
Just a dumb little app I made.

Someone told me that for a job interview the employer asked them to write something in python that called them
every friday at 5pm and read them the top post on reddit.

I thought this was a cool little project, so I tried doing it myself. I settled on this because I dont
know how text to speech works.

Reads the top post on reddit, messages it to a person on skype
